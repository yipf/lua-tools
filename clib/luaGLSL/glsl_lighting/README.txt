glsl_lighting (December 30, 2010)
---------------------------------
This is an OpenGL demo featuring simple per-pixel diffuse/specular
lighting using vertex/fragment shaders written in GLSL; the demo
was posted along with an article at: http://joshbeam.com/

To build the program, just run 'make' in the glsl_lighting directory.
This will create a glsl_lighting executable that you will then be able
to run. You may have to edit the Makefile if your GL headers/libraries
are not under the /usr/X11R6 directory.

This program is released under a BSD-style license. You can find the
copyright notice and license conditions at the beginning of any of the
source code files (such as main.c).
